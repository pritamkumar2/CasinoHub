I am facing an issue with the current implementation of the singleMatch page. The page currently displays static match data, which does not update in real-time. This is problematic because it does not provide live ball-by-ball updates, which are crucial for users who are following the match closely. Without real-time updates, users may miss critical moments and accurate match progression.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would like to see live ball-by-ball data integrated into the singleMatch page. This solution should include:
- Real-time updates on the current state of the match, including ball-by-ball data.
- Integration with a real-time sports data API or WebSocket service that provides live updates.
- A dynamic display on the singleMatch page showing ongoing actions, scores, and other relevant statistics as they happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

As an alternative to real-time updates, we could implement periodic polling to refresh match data at set intervals. However, this approach might result in less responsive updates compared to real-time data and may not be as efficient in delivering live match details.

**Additional context**

Integrating live ball-by-ball data will greatly enhance the user experience by providing up-to-the-minute updates and ensuring that users have the latest information on match events. If possible, include screenshots or examples of similar features from other sports platforms to illustrate how this could be implemented.
